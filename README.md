# diySextantScale

* Sextant scale images generated programatically to have geometrically correct proportions.
* Original size is for printing on A4 sized paper with 600 DPI resolution. 
* For better results use heavy 150 g/m2 paper, ink-jet or laser. 

Scales are Vernier kind with 3 options in respect to small scale tick size:
* 20' per tick
* 30' per tick
* 1 degree per tick

Which one is better ?

edit: 2nd version of "one degree" scale has two verniers side-by-side, to allow reading large angles ( If A > 61 deg, you use the right vernier to read the minutes )
